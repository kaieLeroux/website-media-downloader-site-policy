## Technical Features (v2.2.1)

### Core Detection Engine
The detection engine has been optimized to handle complex web environments more efficiently. This version introduces:
- **Enhanced Stream Detection**: Improved accuracy in identifying and filtering HLS and DASH segments to prevent redundant entries.
- **Parallel Acquisition Overhaul**: A refined multi-threaded fetching mechanism that provides more stable and efficient Speed Boost downloads.
- **Improved Lifecycle Management**: Enhanced cleanup and state persistence when reopening the extension popup while downloads are active.

### UI Architecture
The interface is built using Material Design 3 (MDUI) components, now featuring:
- **Media Grouping System**: Categorizes media into discrete cards (Videos, Audio, Streams, Images, Subtitles, Files) with live item counts and dedicated view navigation.
- **Multiple Settings Layouts**: Flexible settings interface supporting Collapsible sections, Sidebar navigation, or Tabbed layout.
- **Direct Manual URL Download**: Seamless entry point for adding external file download links directly into the media list.
- **Custom Pill Dropdowns**: A modern, space-efficient settings interface featuring dynamic sizing that fits content perfectly.
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Real-time visual feedback for Speed Boost status and multi-threaded download progress.
- **Comprehensive Localization**: A fully localized experience across 9 languages for all UI elements, including installation and error pages.

### Detection Methodology
- **Network Traffic Interception**: Monitors real-time network requests to identify high-bitrate media and dynamic streaming manifests, including M3U8 and MPD files.
- **Deep DOM Scanning**: Systematically inspects HTML5 tags, custom data attributes, and elements managed by lazy-loading frameworks.
- **CSS Analysis**: Identifies media assets embedded within computed styles, such as background and border images.

### Stream Reconstruction
- **HLS (M3U8)**: Supports master and media playlists with variant selection for specific resolutions. It handles local AES-128 decryption and merges segments into standardized containers.
- **DASH (MPD)**: Parses XML-based manifests to extract video and audio adaptation sets.
- **Parallel Acquisition**: Implements a multi-threaded fetching mechanism to optimize throughput and reduce download duration.

### Speed Boost Technology
Website Media Downloader features an advanced **Speed Boost** mechanism designed to saturate your bandwidth and significantly reduce download times.

#### How it Works
- **Single File Downloads**: For standard files (such as MP4, MP3, and other static files), the extension attempts to split the file into multiple chunks. It uses HTTP **Range Requests** to download these chunks simultaneously across multiple parallel connections.
- **Stream Downloads (HLS or DASH)**: Instead of fetching segments one by one, the extension initiates a pool of concurrent requests. This allows it to fetch multiple `.ts` or `.m4s` segments at the same time, bypassing the latency of sequential requests.

#### Key Differences
| Feature | Standard Download | Speed Boost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Connections** | Single (1) | Multi-threaded (up to 16) |
| **Strategy** | Sequential fetching | Parallel acquisition |
| **Efficiency** | Limited by single-thread speed | Maximizes available bandwidth |
| **Resources** | Low CPU/RAM usage | Higher resource utilization |

#### Support & Requirements
- **Server Support**: For single files, the host server must support **Partial Content (HTTP 206)** and provide the `Accept-Ranges: bytes` header. If not supported, the extension automatically falls back to standard sequential downloading.
- **File Size**: Speed Boost is automatically triggered for files larger than **2MB** to ensure efficiency gains outweigh the overhead of managing multiple connections.
- **Visual Indicator**: When Speed Boost is supported and active, the download status text will turn **bold and use your themed/accent color**. If not supported (or for standard sequential downloads), the status text and progress bar will use the default standard appearance. You can configure the number of parallel connections (up to 16 connections) in the extension settings.

### Request Simulation
The extension utilizes header management, including Referer, Origin, and Cookies, to replicate the original request context. This ensures compatibility with servers that restrict access based on request origins.

### Update Mechanism
The extension features an advanced, multi-tiered update checker that automatically runs when the popup is opened.
- **Native Store Check**: On supported platforms, the extension performs a native update check.
- **GitHub Fallback**: The extension queries the project's GitHub repository manifest file. This ensures you are notified of new versions as soon as they are released.

You can also manually trigger an update check at any time via the **About** page within the extension.

## Building

```bash
# Build both Chrome and Firefox
node src/build.js all

# Build Chrome only
node src/build.js chrome

# Build Firefox only
node src/build.js firefox

# Clean build output
node src/build.js clean
```

Build output goes to `build/chrome/` and `build/firefox/`, each containing a ready-to-load extension.

## Installation

Website Media Downloader is available for Chrome.

### Chrome / Chromium
1. Run `node src/build.js chrome`
2. Open `chrome://extensions/` and enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `build/chrome/` folder

## Troubleshooting

- **Media not detected?** Try refreshing the page and playing the video again. If it still doesn't show up, go to Settings and enable "Detection via server's MIME response".
- **Download fails?** Some sites use DRM (Digital Rights Management) or encryption. This extension cannot download encrypted content (like Netflix or Amazon Prime).
- **403 Forbidden on images?** This is often caused by session-based security tokens. It is highly recommended to stay on the current page until downloads are finished. Navigating to the next page or switching lists too quickly can invalidate the request context.
- **Broken files?** If a converted stream doesn't play, try downloading the "Direct Manifest" and playing it with VLC Media Player.
