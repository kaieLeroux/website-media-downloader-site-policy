## Technical Features (v2.0.1)

### Core Detection Engine
The detection engine has been optimized to handle complex web environments more efficiently. This version introduces:
- **Enhanced Stream Detection**: Improved accuracy in identifying and filtering HLS/DASH segments to prevent redundant entries.
- **Parallel Acquisition Overhaul**: Refined multi-threaded fetching mechanism for more stable and efficient Speed Boost downloads.
- **Improved Lifecycle Management**: Enhanced cleanup and state persistence when reopening the extension popup during active downloads.

### UI Architecture
The interface is built using Material Design 3 (MDUI) components, now featuring:
- **Custom Pill Dropdowns**: A modern, space-efficient settings interface with dynamic sizing that fits content perfectly.
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Real-time visual feedback for Speed Boost status and multi-threaded acquisition progress.
- **Comprehensive Localization**: Fully localized experience across 9 languages for all UI elements, including installation and error pages.

### Detection Methodology
- Network Traffic Interception: Monitors real-time network requests to identify high-bitrate media and dynamic streaming manifests (M3U8 and MPD).
- Deep DOM Scanning: Systematically inspects HTML5 tags, custom data attributes, and elements managed by lazy-loading frameworks.
- CSS Analysis: Identifies media assets embedded within computed styles, such as background and border images.

### Stream Reconstruction
- HLS (M3U8): Supports master and media playlists with variant selection for specific resolutions. It handles local AES-128 decryption and merges segments into standardized containers.
- DASH (MPD): Parses XML-based manifests to extract video and audio adaptation sets.
- Parallel Acquisition: Implements a multi-threaded fetching mechanism to optimize throughput and reduce download duration.

### Speed Boost Technology
Website Media Downloader features an advanced **Speed Boost** mechanism designed to saturate your bandwidth and significantly reduce download times.

#### How it Works
- **Single File Downloads**: For standard files (MP4, MP3, etc.), the extension attempts to split the file into multiple chunks. It uses HTTP **Range Requests** to download these chunks simultaneously across multiple parallel connections.
- **Stream Downloads (HLS/DASH)**: Instead of fetching segments one by one, the extension initiates a pool of concurrent requests. This allows it to fetch multiple `.ts` or `.m4s` segments at the same time, overcoming the latency of sequential requests.

#### Key Differences
| Feature | Standard Download | Speed Boost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Connections** | Single (1) | Multi-threaded (up to 16) |
| **Strategy** | Sequential fetching | Parallel acquisition |
| **Efficiency** | Limited by single-thread speed | Maximizes available bandwidth |
| **Resources** | Low CPU/RAM usage | Higher resource utilization |

#### Support & Requirements
- **Server Support**: For single files, the host server must support **Partial Content (HTTP 206)** and provide the `Accept-Ranges: bytes` header. If not supported, the extension automatically falls back to standard sequential downloading.
- **File Size**: Speed Boost is automatically triggered for files larger than **2MB** to ensure efficiency gains outweigh the overhead of managing multiple connections.
- **Visual Indicator**: When Speed Boost is supported and active, the download status text will turn **bold and use your themed/accent color**. If not supported (or for sequential downloads), the status text and progress bar will use the default standard appearance. You can configure the number of parallel connections (up to 16) in the extension settings.

### Request Simulation
The extension utilizes header management (Referer, Origin, and Cookies) to replicate the original request context, ensuring compatibility with servers that implement access restrictions based on request origins.

### Update Mechanism
The extension features a built-in update checker that automatically runs when the popup is opened. It queries the GitHub repository's manifest file to compare versions and notifies users via an in-app dialog if a newer release is available. You can also manually check for updates via the "About" page within the extension.

**Note on Store Updates vs. GitHub Releases:**
This update detection specifically monitors new releases on our GitHub repository. Frequently, a new version is available on GitHub before it passes the review process and becomes available on the Mozilla Add-ons (AMO) store. If you are notified of an update but AMO still serves the older version, you can choose to wait for the store update or manually install the latest release.

**Manual Installation (.xpi) for Firefox:**
To manually install the `.xpi` file from GitHub Releases, you **must use Firefox Developer Edition or Firefox Nightly**. Standard Firefox versions restrict the installation of unlisted or manually downloaded extensions for security reasons.
1. Open Firefox Developer Edition or Firefox Nightly and navigate to `about:config`.
2. Accept the risk warning, then search for `xpinstall.signatures.required` and double-click it to set it to **false**.
3. Download the latest `.xpi` file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/anpa26/website-media-downloader/releases) page.
4. Navigate to the Add-ons manager (`about:addons`).
5. Click the gear icon and select **"Install Add-on From File..."**.
6. Select the downloaded `.xpi` file and confirm the installation.

## Installation

Website Media Downloader is officially available for the Firefox ecosystem.

### Firefox Desktop & Android
You can install the extension directly from the official Firefox Add-ons store:

[**Download on Firefox Add-ons (AMO)**](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/website-media-downloader/)

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended Platform**: While this extension supports Android, it is **highly recommended to use it on Desktop/PC** for the best experience. Desktop browsers offer better stability for background processing, stream reconstruction, and large batch ZIP downloads.

## Troubleshooting

- **Media not detected?** Try refreshing the page and playing the video again. If it still doesn't show up, go to Settings and enable "Detection via server's MIME response".
- **Download fails?** Some sites use DRM (Digital Rights Management) or encryption. This extension cannot download encrypted content (like Netflix or Amazon Prime).
- **403 Forbidden on images?** This is often caused by session-based security tokens. It is highly recommended to stay on the current page until downloads are finished. Navigating to the next page or switching lists too quickly can invalidate the request context.
- **Broken files?** If a converted stream doesn't play, try downloading the "Direct Manifest" and playing it with VLC Media Player.
